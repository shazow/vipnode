        <p>The goal is to allow the Ethereum network to remain decentralized by creating a financial marketplace for more people to run full nodes and serve native light clients.</p>

        <h3>There arenâ€™t enough nodes available.</h3>
        <p>Whenever Ethereum usage spikes, there are more light clients on the network than there are full nodes to support them all. It can take hours to get online.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="sq teal"></div>
        <h3>We need more full nodes with light nodes slots.</h3>
        <p>Running a full node isn't free. It can cost upwards of $60/mo on AWS. Many nodes are run as a donation to the community, but it's not sustainable.</p>

        <h3>Vipnode creates an economic incentive to run a full node.</h3>
        <p>Pay a small subscription fee to get priority access to a collection of full nodes who share the profit.</p>

        <div class="sq yellow"></div>
        <h3>Paying for vip access means you can always get online instantly.</h3>
        <p>Instead of waiting hours for your light client to try to find a full node with space for you, vipnodes prioritize paying customers for instant access.</p>

          <p>
            Similar to how mining pools work, vipnode pools will support third-party full nodes to join as hosts and share in the profit from paying vip clients.
